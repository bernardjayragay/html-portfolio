<h1>The Best Movie for Bernard so far...</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movie so far..</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>Priest 2011</h3>
 <p>I love this movie on how intense every action scene and its a horror type though not totally </p>
 <h3>Avatar: The Way of Water</h3>
 <p>At its core, it’s a story about family, protection, and sacrifice. Jake isn’t just a warrior anymore—he’s a father.<br/> 
    That shift makes the conflict more emotional and relatable, especially if you value family or responsibility in life.</p>
<h3>Inside Out 2</h3>
<p>Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui aren’t gimmicks—they represent how complex emotions become as we grow older. <br/>
    Joy can’t control everything anymore, and that’s an important lesson.</p>
