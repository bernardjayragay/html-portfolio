<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 25-year-old IT graduate from Samar State University, currently working toward building a career in the tech industry. I am seeking entry-level and remote-friendly opportunities, particularly in data analytics, data entry, and software development.
While I am still improving my coding skills, I am highly motivated, eager to learn, and committed to continuous self-development.</p>

<p>I have hands-on academic experience using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, AJAX, and Excel at an intermediate level, including developing my thesis system and integrating a chatbot. 
I prefer growth-focused roles rather than hardware or IT support positions, and I am exploring both front-end and back-end development paths. 
I value discipline, consistency, and long-term career growth, and I am actively strengthening my skills to become a capable and reliable professional in the tech field.</p>
